## Running these contracts

You will need Rust 1.66.0+ with wasm32-unknown-unknown target installed.

### Build the contract

The contracts can be compiled using [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-build.html)

```
cargo build
```

with the optimizer is

```toml
optimizer_version = '0.12.11'
```

Build .wasm file stored in `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/<CONTRACT_NAME>.wasm`
`--no-wasm-opt` is suitable for development, explained below

### Testing the contract

To run the tests for the contract, run the following command:

```bash
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo unit-test
```

This will build the contract and run a series of tests to ensure that it functions correctly. The tests are defined in the ./tests directory.
